In class, we did a lot of review to help solidify new concepts that we have learned, since the topics we are covering are starting to stack up.  Constructor functions were familiar to me, so it was nice to review it and nail the syntax down.  We also learned how to use JavaScript to generate and insert a data table into and HTML document, which was pretty cool.  Now that we can insert tags and manipulate classes in HTML, I can see how everything is coming together and we will be able to make a fully responsive website once we talk about event handling.  I'm very excited about this and can't believe that I will be able to make a fully responsive front-end in the middle of week 2!
