# Learning Journal 201 Day 9

## Topics

- Git review
- Advanced CSS
- Lab

We began the class reviewing our git and GitHub methods for forking, branching, and merging, which was very helpful for me because git can sometimes be confusing.  We then had a break and together built a standard 960px layout from scratch, which was great to see.  It cleared up a lot of questions and showed how a minimalist approach is usually the best way.  After lunch, we had our lab, which was focused on the CSS.  I did a layout based on the one we built today, and it looks much better than before.  I learned a lot, and also made a stretch goal of improving the table.
