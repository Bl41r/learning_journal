# Learning Journal 201 Day 4

## Topics

- Code review
- HTML/CSS
- JS functions
- Pair programming

Today, we continued our code review with Liz's work.  We spent a lot of time on it and did not have time to do anyone else's.  We then studied some HTML/CSS stuff about positioning and the box model.  It was very informative and I can tell will require a lot of practice to master.  After that, we briefly mentioned JS functions, not yet covering scope and passing in variables or returns.  We then went on to pair programming, and I worked with both Erica and Derek.  It was very nice to work together because it helped my code, but it also helped me to think about other ways to solve a problem.
