# Learning Journal 201 Day 11

## Topics

- Quiz review
- Code review
- Lab overview
- Lab

We started the day by going over the past 3 quizzes.  The quizzes have started to become more challenging, so it was good to go over them again.  We then went over some code review, and saw one student's who figured out how to create data persistence, which I had wanted to implement but was too tired to pursue.  For lab, our goal is to build a market analysis app which shows a user 3 images, and stores the user's preferences and storing the data.
