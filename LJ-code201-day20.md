# Learning Journal 201 Day 20

Today was the last day of class.  We watched the iOS presentations and then had a pizza lunch and presented our own.  All of the projects looked great and were fun to watch.  It's amazing to think back to the first day, and then look at the completed project that we made.  I can tell that I have learned a tremendous amount, and I look forward to continuing bright and early on Monday.  Thanks, Sam, Brian, Nick,and Nadia!
