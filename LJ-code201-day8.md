# Learning Journal 201 Day 7

## Topics

- Code Review
- Event handling
- HTML Forms
- More event handling
- Lab

We started the day off with a code review of Erica's code.  She had very well structured code.  We then had Nick go over event handling in JavaScript.  He made several examples to show the kinds of things that we could do with events on a webpage.  Then Brian went over the forms from the HTML/CSS side and we got better understanding of the different kinds of inputs we could, and different ways they can be styled.  Afterwards, Sam gave a demonstration of using events to make a message board like program.  In lab, we worked as partners, and I was partnered with Logan.  We made a whiteboard detailing the steps we had to do and knocked out the basics by 3:00.  I continued working afterwards and made a couple of data validation functions.  It was a very productive day, overall.
