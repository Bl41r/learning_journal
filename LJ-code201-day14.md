# Learning Journal 201 Day 14

## Topics
- Code Review
- Advanced JS
- CSS
- Project Teams

We started the day with a code review and looked over my code.  Thankfully it was relatively clean.  We then went over where to go from here in learning about JavaScript, talking about NodeJS and the newest version of JavaScript, along with some books to read.  We then moved on the a CSS demo and learned how to make a page with elements that appear to move using CSS transitions and keypad input.  I messed around with it and got the ball to move a set number of pixels with each arrow key and allowed the ball to be placed anywhere the user wants.  After that, we voted on projects and teams were formed, and we practiced our Git lab to practice resolving merge conflicts and preventing them.  We also began a discussion about our project to get a good idea about what we wanted to accomplish.
