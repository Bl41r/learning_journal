We started the day with a high level discussion about concepts we have learned about in class.  We then learned about the topics for the 301 class that we will be learning about and what we will be able to do with them.  We also saw a little bit of jQuery and Node.js coding.  We then watched presentations about the iOS and python 401 classes.  After lunch, we went to go watch the project presentations of the 301 class.  Afterwards, we went spent the remaining time with our groups, discussing the project and what we need to do for an MVP, as well as what to do over the weekend.  We made a lot of idea progress and are on the same page now.
