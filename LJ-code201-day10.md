# Learning Journal 201 Day 10

## Topics

- Final Projects
- Code review
- UI/UX

We started the day looking at projects from previous students in the class.  Most of them were games and and were very impressive.  It was good to get an idea about how much work and effort will be put into this project coming up.  We then did a code review, and in that review we built a handy buildElement function to simplify the process of making HTML elements for out page to make our code look cleaner.  We then went over more user interface ideas, learning how to insert a scrollable text box into our structure that we built yesterday.  Time went by fast and we did not yet get to JS error debugging or CSS animations yet.  We then worked in groups on a website project to duplicate a website design from a static copy.  It went really well, and I am getting better at getting past the CSS headaches.
