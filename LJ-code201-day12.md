# Learning Journal 201 Day 12

## Topics
- Lab review
- Chart.js


We started the day by going over the previous day's lab assignment by building out the algorithm for getting random images which do not repeat or show images from the previous showing.  We then learned about making charts with chart.js, and went off to lab to make our own charts.  It was a little hard at first, but once it was made it became easier to deal with.
