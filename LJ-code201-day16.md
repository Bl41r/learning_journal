# Learning Journal 201 Day 16

- Today, we spent the entire day on our projects.  We did a lot of work over the weekend and made a lot of progress today as well.  We almost have our MVP with some stretch goals as well, such as multi-variable sorting.  There was a lot of debugging, but it was a good learning experience and in the end we were able to accomplish more than we set out to do.
