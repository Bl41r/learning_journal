# Learning Journal 201 Day 13

## Topics
- Code Review
- UI/UX
- Local Storage with JSON
- Project Pitches

We started off with a code review, looking at Doug's impressive work with the chart.js.  We then had Brian show how to create a flyout menu, as well as a button which would manipulate another shape.  It was important to see some of the subtle things that have to be controlled, like the text appearance and timing of the css animation.  We then learned about how to save information locally,and then retrieve it using JSON to stringify and parse.  It was important to learn how objects are stripped of methods and inheritance.  After lunch, we did some project pitches and came up with some good ideas for project week.  I finished my lab early today, so I looked into using google to implement a chart for the BusMall application.
