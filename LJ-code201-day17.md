# Learning Journal 201 Day 17

Today we worked on our projects and worked to get a MVP.  I worked on adding a review submission form, as well as solving a marker overlap bug, as well as many other misc. bugs in the code.  Our project is really coming together and should be very ready in time for presentation day.
