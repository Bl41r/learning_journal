# Learning Journal 201 Day 6

## Topics
- Objects
- DOM
- CSS

We first learned about Objects by creating an RPG character with Nick.  We then went over the DOM with Brian.  We also went over some developer tools in chrome (if only I had known about the color dropper trick earlier!).  We then continued our discussion on Objects, talking about properties and methods.  After lunch, we worked on our cookie-stand project for a while, and then took a break to have Brian explain more CSS box techniques.  Afterwards, we resumed work on our weekly lab.  Overall it went well, and I finished the JavaScript portion well.  The CSS is considerably harder than the coding aspect, but it is slowly improving each day.
