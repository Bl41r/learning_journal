# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

Today we did out first code review, and Liz volunteered to be the first ~~victim~~ volunteer.  It went well and she was a good sport.  

We then created our git project for this journal, learning how to start a project locally and then upload it to github.

Next we discussed some elementary JavaScript variable name conventions, control flow syntax.  We then talked about Arrays.

We then went on to our lab where we added 2 new questions, one being a number guessing game, and one involving multiple correct answers in an array.  We used looping to solve them.  I also made a recursive function to solve the first new problem for fun.
